1. An adjacent color palette for introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=52x1n0kOhCDp9MsxXNlOSrwPRli

Your Rationale: I chose these colors due to the previous success Microsoft had with their Xbox console line up.  Because of that, I wanted to include an edgy green color, with a darker blue and yellow to bring out the positive energy and imagery that video gaming can develop for the standard user.

2. A triadic color palette for announcing Chicago Botanical Gardens springtime tours.

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=34U110kKHJsmGLDtaKJKWsHM2mk

Your Rationale: I chose this triadic color scheme to bring warmth and calmness to the viewer when they visit the Botanical Gardens.  Right when the flowers blossom, the bright yellow shines at the peak of the flowers lifespan.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for a private messaging app

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=35v0I0kzECBh+SkpdJy-0nJGrc0

Your Rationale: I chose these colors to welcome those to our new chatting application.  Emotions run high with whoever it is you are conversating with, so the red brings out the intensity, while the blue and yellow can bring out the joy and excitement you feel during conversations.

4. A monochromatic color palette for advertising a course on Ruby on Rails

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=15t0I0kIFuVsUPMDRL+GpocH5hM
 
Your Rationale: Ruby always reminded me of a deeper color symbolism for red, which is why I chose it.  The shiny that glistens off of the gem and how deep it can reflect for is beyond words, and Ruby is a perfect color to resemble the language for its purpose.
